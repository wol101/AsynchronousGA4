# AsynchronousGA2022
This is genetic algorithm server that uses multiple GaitSym clients on multiple computers to perform optimisation tasks. It uses an asynchronous approach that will happily keep thousands of GaitSym clients running at very high efficiency even over quite slow networks. It occasionally falls over but I think that is mostly due to things like port exhaustion since it can open a very large number of connections. It has been tested on Windows and Linux, and it uses a GUI supervising a separate command line program so that it can be run on a machine with no GUI interface if wanted. The set up is a little bit complicated but once it is working, it behaves itself very well.
